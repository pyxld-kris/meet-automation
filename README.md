A set of TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey scripts which allow a computer/vps to automatically allow entry into a Google Meet room when a visitor requests access. It also persists connection with the room indefinitely by reconnecting on an interval.


### Getting Started
 1. Install either the TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey extension
 2. Add the four individual scripts to the plugin. Be sure they are active.
 3. Visit https://devlaunchers.com/#/hangout
 4. The scripts should begin executing, auto opening rooms and joining meets
